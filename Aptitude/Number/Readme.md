General Concepts....
Place values and Local values of a Digit in a Numeral
    For example, in the numeral 68974532, we have:
    Place value of 2 is 2 units = 2;
    Palce value of 3 is 3 tens = 30;
    Place value of 5 is 5 hundreds = 500;
    Place value of 4 is 4 thousands = 4000;
    Place value of 7 is 7 ten thousands = 70000;
    Place value of 9 is 9 lacs = 900000;
    Place value of 8 is 8 ten lacs = 8000000;
    Place value of 6 is 6 Crores = 60000000;

Face value: The face value of a digit in a numeral is the value of the digit iteself at whatever palce it may be.

Even numbers: A number is divisible by 2 is called an even number.
    Example, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 etc.

Odd numbers: A number not divisible by 2 is called an odd number.
    Example, 1,3,5,7,9,11,13 etc.

    > To represent in form computer programming, we use mathematics function mod(%) to check for the even and odd numbers. (As shown in evenOdd.py)

        if number % 2 == 0:
            print (number is even)
        else:
            print (odd)


Prime numbers: Every number larger than 1 having exactly two factors is called a prime numbers.
    Example, 2,3,5,7,9,11,13,17,19,23 etc.

TESTS OF DIVISIBILITY: 

Divisibility by 2: A number is divisible by 2, if its unit digit is any of 0,2,4,6,,8.
Divisibility by 3: A number is divisible by 3, if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
Divisibility by 4: A number is divisible by 4, if the last two digits are divisible by 4.
Divisibility by 5: A number is divisible by 5, if its unit digit is 0, 5.
Divisibility by 6: A number is divisible by 6, if it is divisible by 2 and 3 both.
Divisibility by 8: A number is divisible by 8, if the last three digits are divisible by 8.
Divisibility by 9: A number is divisible by 9, if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
Divisibility by 10: A number is divisible by 10, if the unit digit is 0.
Divisibility by 11: A number is divisible by 11, if the difference of the sum of its digits at odd places and the sum of its digits
                    at even places, is either 0 or divisible by 11.


Co-Prime: Two numbers are said to be co-prime, if their H.C.F(Highest Common Factor) is 1.

Note: A numbers is divisible by ab only when that number is divisible by each one of a and b, where a and b are co-prime.
